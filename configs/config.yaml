# Training stage (1 or 2)
stage: 1

# Device configuration
device: 0  # GPU index, or -1 for CPU

# Model compilation
compile: false

# Model saving
save_model: true
save_frequency: 1

# Pretrained model (for Stage 2)
pretrained_path: null  # Path to pretrained Stage 1 model checkpoint

# Data configuration
num_samples: 500
batch_size: 32

# Data generation (for generate_data.py)
steps: 1000  # Number of simulation steps to generate
transfer_batch_size: 100  # Number of steps to accumulate on GPU before transferring to CPU (higher = better GPU utilization, more GPU memory)
