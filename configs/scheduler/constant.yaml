# @package scheduler
# Constant learning rate scheduler (no change in LR during training)
# This is effectively what the original Stage 2 training uses due to a bug
# in their scheduler stepping logic.

scheduler_type: ConstantLR
factor: 1.0  # Multiply base LR by this factor (1.0 = no change)
total_iters: 0  # Number of steps to apply the factor (0 = entire training)
